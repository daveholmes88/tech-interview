Using Javascript & React, please build a kanban board, an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work. This project should meet the following requirements:

1. The kanban board should have 3 swimlanes named Ready, In Progress and Completed.

2. There is functionality to add & delete a ticket. Once created, the tickets should appear under the "Ready" swimlane.

3. Each ticket should have a name, a description, buttons to move back and forth between swim lanes, and a delete button.

4. Allow each ticket to move between swimlanes.

5. You can add basic styling using a CSS library of your choice or use the styled components in App.js.

6. There is no requirement to persist these tickets in a database.

Using Javascript & React, please build a kanban board! This project should meet the following requirements:

1. The kanban board should have 3 swimlanes.

2. There is functionality to add & delete a ticket.

3. Each ticket should have the ability to have a name and description.

4. Allow each ticket to move between swimlanes. This can be accomplished with buttons on each ticket.

5. Add basic styling using a CSS library of your choice.

6. There is no requirement to persist these tickets in a database.
